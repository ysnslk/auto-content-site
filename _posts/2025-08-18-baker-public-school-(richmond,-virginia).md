The Baker Public School is a pair of historic school buildings at 100 West Baker Street in Richmond, Virginia. It consists of a small Colonial Revival brick building constructed in 1913 as an annex to an older building, and a larger 1939 Art Deco building built out of limestone and brick. The latter is in an arrow shape, with its main entrance set at an angle facing the corner West Charity and St. Paul Streets. The school served the African-American neighborhood of Jackson Ward until 1979.

Corythomantis is a small genus of hylid frogs endemic to northeastern Brazil. It was monotypic until description of a second species, Corythomantis galeata in 2012, though this species was later moved to Nyctimantis. Corythomantis botoque was described in 2021. These frogs are sometimes known under common name Greening's frogs.

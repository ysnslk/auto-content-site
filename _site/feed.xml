It is located approximately 760 light years distant from the Sun and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of 35 km/s. This is a thermally-pulsating Mira variable that ranges in brightness from magnitude 5.3 down to 12.0 with a period of 269.84 days. The period was over 300 days when first observed, and has declined steadily since – decreasing from 320 in 1915 down to 264 in 2010, at an average rate of 0.4 days per year. The amplitude of the variation has also decreased by about a magnitude since discovery. The peak magnitude is bright enough for the star to be visible to the naked eye as a dim, red-hued star.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[R Aquilae is a variable star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila.
